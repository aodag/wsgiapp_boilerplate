WSGI Application Boilerplate
=======================================




Introduction
------------

thinking this doesn't have be a top-level section, but rather just a paragraph or two at the top of the index page.
should include the following links:  User list | Dev list | Issues | Github | PyPI | irc
(e.g. see http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/)


Installation
------------

should be a top-level section, even if it's short.


Quickstart
----------

super quick command sequences to get going.
e.g. for pip, covers the basic 4 or 5 pip commands people use.


User Guide
----------

*not* a reference, but a topical guide that covers the common situations and commands people need.


Reference Guide
---------------

ideally, this is automated through introspection of command classes, and option objects. (e.g. pip's "usage" section is currently automated)

- e.g. for pip, should cover all subcommands and options.
- e.g. for wheel's bdist_wheel, it should cover all the options
- e.g. for setuptools, should cover all setup.py commands and options (including pure-distutils)


Development
-----------

- how to test
- release procedures
- how to get involved
- irc channels...


Release History
---------------

- the changelog
- don't use sections to mark releases, because it makes the TOC too noisy
